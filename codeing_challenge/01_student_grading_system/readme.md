This is my pseudo code:



start
hey 'Maiwand', im here to ask about your grades!
if the score is greater or between 90:
print "wow, your grade is so perfect, it's A"
if the score is in between 80 and 89:
print "you did good, your grade is B"
if the score is greater or in between 70 and 79:
print "you've passed, your grade is C"
if the score is lower than 60:
print "aw man, you have failed the class"
if the score is in between 60 and 69:
print "your grade is D!"
at the end:
print "well 'Maiwand' I know you did your best in this course and I wish you good luck to future challenges"
ask a question:
input "if there is any other question, let me know!"
